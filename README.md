## Bounce

## Ideas

- 4 squares bonk in coners at same time - different pitched sounds for each
  (reversed)
- Conglomerates - squares of the similar color combine when colliding with each
  other
- Simple square bouncing quickly - changes colors with each wall hit - leaves
  tail until filled with full grid geometry
- Square races - 4 squares
  - Tron style tails
  - Lazers and other defenses along path
- Bouncing with different shapes - shapes need to fit in their holes
- Bouncing letters - pause to make a word
- Reading rainbow bounces
- Upgrade sound hook to better handle concurrency
